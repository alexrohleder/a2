### :sparkles: Features

- **Widely opinionated**: [the community opinion is more than welcome](#muscle-contributing), is part of the project!
- **Authentication in several ways**: such as Facebook, Google and normal email/password combination.
- **Password recovery**: easily provided by Firebase and [wrapped into vuex store to an amazing integration](docs/state.md).
- **Complete boilerplate**: you can use [this vuex store](docs/state.md) in your project, almost as easy as a drop-in.
- **Amazing documentation**: you can read the [created and planned articles](docs/articles.md) or go to the more [technical documentation](docs/overview.md).
